# Mintbeant / General Assembly Hackathon: Meme Generator

The objective was to build a meme generator in 4 hours. We were given some suggestions on APIs to use for the images but other then that, it was up to us to decide what stack to use to build it. I chose React, since I knew there would be a lot of components that would change based on user input. 

## Technology Used
HTML/CSS
React
[IMG Flip API](https://api.imgflip.com/)


## Next Steps
- to be able to download the image
- to move the text OR to use a template s othat hte text moves based on the image chosen
